GM Tabletop Manager v0.0.4 (Project Shapies)
=======

What started out as a testing ground for trying out new features (such as canvas shapes) has evolved into a suite of simple tools for the Game Master of Tabletop RPGs. Hopefully this project turns out to be useful!

This is not an attempt to replace any licensed material from the publishers.
